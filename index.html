    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">History</h5>
    <p class="text-muted">Ngee Ann Primary School was formerly known as Ngee Ann Girls’ School. In 1940, The Ngee Ann Kongsi's Board of Directors comprising the late Mr Lee Wee Nam, the late Mr Yeo Chan Boon, the late Mr Lim Kim Seng and a few other members set up this institution to encourage education for girls.

      The school ground was a bungalow owned by a Kongsi member situated at 229, River Valley Road, where Teo Yeonh Huai Kuan stands today. During the Japanese Occupation, the girls’ school was forced to close down but was reinstated shortly after the war in the mid 1950s. At that time, the school population increased to about 1000 and it also achieved the status of a government-aided school. Post World War Two saw the need for restructuring of the economy to meet the challenges of the period and develop it to one that would put Singapore in the global network. This affected the mindset of parents who decided that English would be the language that would put their children at an advantage. With this demand, English became the medium of instruction in Mathematics and Science.</p>
